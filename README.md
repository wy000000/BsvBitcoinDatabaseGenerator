# BsvBitcoinDatabaseGenerator

This is a fork of BitcoinDatabaseGenerator (Author: Ladislau Molnar).

The BlockChain parsing .dll is updated to BsvBitcoinBlockChain.dll.

BsvBitcoinDatabaseGenerator is a high performance data transfer tool that can be used to copy data from BitcoinSV blockchain files to a SQL Server database (also works for BTC and BCH).
